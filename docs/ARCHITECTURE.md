# Architecture

A concise map of the codebase for anyone (human or model) picking this up
cold. See [`VISION.md`](VISION.md) for why, [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) for
the wire format, [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) for what's left.

## Modules

```
cmd/paywall-sandbox/    CLI entrypoint: subcommand dispatch + flag parsing
internal/paywall/       Wire types shared by both sides: Descriptor, Proof
internal/mockserver/    The mock 402 server: Rule matching, Server, logging
internal/client/        The CLI client side: Signer, Loop (challenge/pay/retry)
```

- **`internal/paywall`** — no dependencies beyond stdlib. Defines
  `Descriptor` (what's owed) and `Proof` (what satisfies it), their JSON
  encode/decode, and the two header names (`X-Payment-Required`,
  `X-Payment`) both sides key off. Anything that needs to speak the wire
  format imports this package; it imports nothing else in this repo.
- **`internal/mockserver`** — the server side. `Rule` describes one
  protected route (method/path/price), matching either an exact path or a
  `/*`-suffixed prefix; `Server` is an `http.Handler` that challenges
  unmatched-proof requests and forwards matched-proof ones to `Next`.
  Nonces are issued and consumed in an in-memory map guarded by a mutex —
  one-time use, hard TTL, no persistence (see `docs/PROTOCOL.md` for why).
  `LogRequests` is a middleware wrapping any handler with structured
  request logging. `LoadRules`/`LoadRulesFile` (`config.go`) parse a JSON
  rule set (see `examples/rules.json`) into `[]Rule`, validating every
  entry.
- **`internal/client`** — the CLI client side. `Signer` builds a `Proof`
  from a received `Descriptor`; `FakeSigner` is the v1 (and only)
  implementation. `Loop` drives the exchange: send, detect a 402, decode
  the descriptor, sign, retry once — returning a `Result` with a
  step-by-step `Steps` trace used for `--verbose` output. Only depends on
  `internal/paywall` and stdlib `net/http`, so it can run against any
  target, not just `internal/mockserver`.
- **`cmd/paywall-sandbox`** — thin CLI wrapper. `serve` stands up a
  `mockserver.Server` with rules either from flags (one rule) or
  `--config <file>` (`mockserver.LoadRulesFile`); `request` drives a
  `client.Loop` against `--url`; `version` prints the build version.

## Data flow (server side)

```
request → Server.ServeHTTP
            → matchRule (Rule.Matches by method + path)
            → no match:            forward to Next
            → match, no/invalid proof:  issue Descriptor, 402
            → match, valid proof:  consume nonce, forward to Next
```

## Data flow (client side)

```
Loop.Do → send initial request
            → status != 402:  return result (Paid=false)
            → status == 402:  decode Descriptor (header, falls back to body)
                               → Signer.Sign(desc) -> Proof
                               → retry with X-Payment header set
                               → return result (Paid=true)
```

## Build / run / test

```
go build -o bin/paywall-sandbox ./cmd/paywall-sandbox
./bin/paywall-sandbox serve --path /paid --amount 100 --asset USDC
go test ./...
```

`make build|test|run|fmt|vet|lint` wrap the above; see `Makefile`.

## Where new work plugs in

- New proof schemes: keep `paywall.Proof.Scheme` as the discriminator;
  `mockserver.Server.acceptProof` is the only place that currently
  hardcodes `FakeScheme` — see `docs/BACKLOG.md`'s pluggable-signer story.
- New signer schemes: implement `client.Signer` and wire a `--scheme` flag
  in `cmd/paywall-sandbox/request.go` to select among them.
- New rule config fields (e.g. per-rule TTL): extend `RuleConfig`/`Rule`
  and `validateRuleConfig` in `internal/mockserver/config.go`; `Server`
  itself doesn't need to change.
